# I am very proud to say that I've finished my first project using React.js

This project is a very simple project that I've implemented using React.js. It allows the user to search for a city and select a day to check how was, how is or how will be the weather.
It's a very simple project were I did get more confidence working with states and other React features. Also, the data is hardcoded in the project and the logic is very simple.

I am really happy about my progress in web development so far. I do have a really good base but I am also learning a lot every time I have some free time to do it.
I want to be even better that this since my skills could improve a lot (especially CSS) but I think I'm on the right path to success.
